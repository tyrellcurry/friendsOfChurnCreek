    listitemtext: >-
      Large areas of grassland ecosystems and open forests in CCPA are being
      lost to tree encroachment and ingrowth. FCCPAS is working with BC Parks
      and other partners such as the Cariboo-Chilcotin Ecosystem Restoration
      Committee and Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation to restore open
      grassland ecosystems by removing tree encroachment. Projects include
      grassland restoration at specific locations and development and
      implementation of a strategy for mapping and treating encroachment.


      FCCPAS also assists BC Parks staff with removal of invasive plants in grasslands and open forests.

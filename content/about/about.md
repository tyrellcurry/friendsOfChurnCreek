  **Churn Creek Protected Area** (CCPA) was established in July 1995 by the
  Province of British Columbia to protect nationally significant grasslands and
  associated wildlife. The Empire Valley Ranch was added in 1998, bringing the
  total area of CCPA to 36,747 ha.


  Although CCPA contains significant Douglas-fir forests, the conservation and management focuses are grasslands and associated wildlife. Uninterrupted grasslands, which are among the most rare and threatened ecosystems in B.C., extend from the bottom of the Fraser River valley where big sagebrush is abundant to extensive mid elevation bunchgrass ecosystems and high elevation grasslands of the Interior Douglas-fir zone. Many of the grasslands are in near-natural condition. Detailed descriptions of the grasslands and their condition are contained in the [CCPA Management Plan](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/planning/mgmtplns/churn_final/churn.html "The approved Churn Creek Protected Area Management Plan") (March 2000).
